# Water-body extraction datasets
# Overview
# GID Land Cover Classification Dataset (Tong et al., 2020): 
  As shown in Figure 3, this dataset provides 150 images with six classes of annotations, and these annotations contain water-body. The ground resolution of each image is 4m/pixel, and the pixel resolution is 6800× 7200. The original 150 training images are split into 120 images for training and 30 for validating. 
# DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset (Demir et al., 2018): 
  This dataset provides 803 images with seven classes of annotations, and these annotations contain water-body. The ground resolution of each image is 0.5m/pixel, and the pixel resolution is 2448× 2448. The original 803 training images are split into 643 images for training and 160 for validating.  
# 2020 CCF BDCI Remote Sensing Image Plot Segmentation Dataset: 
  This dataset provides 145981 images with seven classes of annotations, and these annotations contain water-body. The ground resolution of each image is 2m/pixel, and the pixel resolution is 256× 256. The original 145981 training images are split into 116785 images for training and 29196 for validating.
